- [ ] Implement missing/partial hooks (pre-push, pre-rebase, post-commit)
- [ ] Enhance configuration management (CLI and user-defined rules)
- [ ] Add user-extensible commit message formats
- [ ] Implement advanced branch, tag, and release management CLI
- [ ] Add code formatting, linting, and documentation generation support
- [ ] Consider GitLab/Bitbucket CI/CD templates if cross-platform support is desired
- [ ] Expand error handling and user feedback for all CLI commands
- [ ] Review and implement other planned and future features as prioritized
